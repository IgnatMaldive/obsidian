### Where did this project come from?
PaintPilot was created with inspiration from the fascinating theories presented in the book "Secret Knowledge" by David Hockney and the documentary movie "Tim's Vermeer". These works explored the techniques used by the old masters to achieve stunning works of art, and PaintPilot brings these techniques into the digital realm. With PaintPilot, you can use the same methods as the masters to achieve the perfect shapes, colors, and values in your artwork.
